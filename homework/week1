1) Finish binary tree implementation
  1.1 add (recursion and loop)
  1.2 remove (current version contains bugs)
  1.3 find depth of tree
  1.4* iterator
  1.5* toString
  1.6* balance tree (look AVL tree)

2) HashMap - finish all unimplemented methods

Don't forget to write tests for your code;
Good luck!
